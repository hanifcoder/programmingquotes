              - Chris Pine <br /><br>
              Especially important for beginners. At first, we're so anxious
              about knowing everything, especially language syntax.
              Problem-solving is the skill we end up using most.

                programs in it."</strong

              - Dennis Ritchie <br /><br>Programmers are mostly "learn by doing"
              types. No amount of academic study or watching other people code
              can compare to breaking open an editor and start making mistakes.

              "Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and
              that's very true of programming."</strong> - Joyce Wheeler <br> <br>When managing
              developers I would always encourage getting up and walking away
              from the computer when you have a problem. Some of your best
              solutions will come to you when you're not at the machine.

            <p><strong>"In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a
              blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a
              combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to do
              with them."</strong>
               - Andrew Hunt <br> <br>Outsiders question whether programming
              is art. Programmers don't.

        <p><strong>“The most damaging phrase in the language is.. it's always been done
          this way.”</strong>
           - Grace Hopper<br> <br> To be a programmer long term, you have to
          love change. You can't just tolerate it, you have to love it.
